# Programs in Cpp - what does this repo contain and how is it organized. 


This is repo has Cpp programs that are basic in nature, a lot of OOP concepts and some data structures are 
implmented in some programs. 

Each program has its own directory and within that directory there is a file with implmentation notes that explains what 
was implmented in the program and the logic behind it. Some program directories will contain also a UML diagram for OOP and multiple classes programs, each folder will have an executable to execute the program in its finals version. 

Here is a breakdown of each program and outline of this directory:



- Program 1: Very basic program to calculate the cost of mowing a lawn, the surface of the Lawn is shown in the         implmentation notes. It calculate the entire cost.
