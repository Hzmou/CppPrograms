# Programs in Cpp - what does this repo contain and how is it organized. 


This is repo has Cpp programs that are basic in nature, a lot of OOP concepts and some data structures are 
implmented in some programs. 

Each program has its own directory and within that directory there is a file with implmentation notes that explains what 
was implmented in the program and the logic behind it. Some program directories will contain also a UML diagram for OOP and multiple classes programs, each folder will have an executable to execute the program in its finals version. 

Here is a breakdown of each program and outline of this directory:


<u>**program-1:**.</u>
  A basic program to calculate the cost of mowing a lawn, the surface of the Lawn is shown in the figure. Introduces basic ideas in Cpp.

<u>**program-02:**.</u>
 Program to ccesses if logic, loops and formatting. The user enters some number of package weights in the range 1.0 to 10.0 pounds, ending data
entry with the sentinel value 0.0. The program should work for any number of entries, including zero entries. It outputs a report of the number of packges and total cost. 

<u>**program-03:**.</u>
This program read data from a file "weather.txt" and outputs a report to output the data in a table, with some statistics about average temperature. 

<u>**program-04:**.</u>

This program reads grades from a file "Grades.txt" and outputs all grades for the students by student ID in a table with average grades and standard deviation for all the grades. 

<u>**program-05:**.</u>
This assignment assesses use dynamic C arrays. The user enters a specified number of friend names
with the best friend stored in the first index of the array followed by "regular" friends in no order. A
sentinel controlled while loop allows the user to edit the best friend until quitting.
